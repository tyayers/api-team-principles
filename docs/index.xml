      <description>The world is digitally connected, but how can we change and adapt to this new API reality, built on openness, integration, and ecosystems?
We as an organization commit ourselves to these 7 API First Principles:
1. Scale APIs are the central nervous system of our organization, both internally and to our customers and partners. Every cent we earn flows through our APIs.
2. Self-Service Every service in our organization, either internal or external, is consumed through documented, versioned, and managed APIs with common identity, security and operations policies, and with automatic self-service onboarding.</description>
