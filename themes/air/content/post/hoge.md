+++

The world is digitally connected, but how can we change and adapt to this new API reality, built on openness, integration, and ecosystems?

We as an organization commit ourselves to these 7 API First Principles:

## 1. Scale
APIs are the central nervous system of our organization, both internally and to our customers and partners.  Every cent we earn flows through our APIs.

## 2. Self-Service
Every service in our organization, either internal or external, is consumed through documented, versioned, and managed APIs with common identity, security and operations policies, and with automatic self-service onboarding.  No exceptions. 

## 3. Transparency
Our API Products are contracts between our internal teams, our customers and our partners, and are documented and curated in professional API Product Portals, where anyone can check any detail or change anytime.

## 4. Innovation
API Products are the stable core of our business, and enable flexible and dynamic client and backend innovation both internally and externally. 

## 5. Improvement
We leverage API telemetry data to measure our success, and base our future business planning on how our API Products are actually used.

## 6. Change
All of our API Products have lifecycles, and API Products that no longer deliver business value are put on a path to deprecation with transparency, honesty, and a realistic migration path to better performing APIs.

## 7. Value
Ecosystems are more important than any single product or API, and API Products help us create ecosystems of value that benefit our customers, our partners, and ourselves (in that order).
